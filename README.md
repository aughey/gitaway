# GitAway

GitAway is a git central repository system that is modeled after github,
but is not intended to replace github.  The purpose of GitAway is
to provide a private gibhub-like system that can be used as private
development environments that may exist on private or public networks.

## Goals

The goals of GitAway are basic and are as follows:

* Do not duplicate github
* Do not replace paid github services (thin ice here)
* Do not replace github:fi (even thinner ice here)
* Provide the most needed features.  80% solution

## Features

As stated before, this is not intended to duplicate github.  While
it is modeled very heavily on github, I do not intend to duplicate
every feature.  Only the commonly used tasks (as defined by me) are
included.

* User Repositories
** Public Repositories
** Private Repositories
* Repository Navigation
** Branches
** Trees
* Collaboration
** Forking
** Multi-user access to repositories
