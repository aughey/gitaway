# GitAway

GitAway is a git central repository system that is modeled after github,
but is not intended to replace github.  The purpose of GitAway is
to provide a private gibhub-like system that can be used as private
development environments that may exist on private or public networks.

## Goals

The goals of GitAway are basic and are as follows:

* Do not duplicate github
* Do not replace paid github services (thin ice here)
* Do not replace github:fi (even thinner ice here)
* Provide the most needed features.  80% solution

GitAway was created to fill the need
